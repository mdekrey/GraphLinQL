# GraphLinqQL

A schema-first C# GraphQL library.

## Our Approach

1. Allow you to write your GraphQL SDL along with your UI developers
2. Generate C# interfaces for ideal type-checking
3. Keep generated code out of your committed code for CI of schema changes.
4. Rely on C#'s `Expression` infrastructure for better support of other C#
    libraries.

# How it works

1. Create your GraphQL schema document using any toolchain you want.

    This file can be generated by tools like `graphql-import` or versioned with your repository.

2. Add [`GraphLinqQL.Resolvers` ![GraphLinqQL.Resolvers](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/GraphLinqQL.Resolvers.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphLinqQL.Resolvers) to your project and add your `.graphql` file.

    This generates C# classes for you to implement.

3. Implement those interfaces.

    Connect them to your Domain model using the expressions that will be
    converted into the IQueryable.

4. Add GraphQL execution to your endpoint. If you are using ASP.NET Core, you can use [`GraphLinqQL.AspNetCore`. ![GraphLinqQL.AspNetCore](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/GraphLinqQL.AspNetCore.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphLinqQL.AspNetCore)
